      K3s runs on many devices - what happens if you have the perfect hardware
      to run it on?


      See how easy it is to build a portable Kubernetes cluster with a
      Clusterboard. I walked the participants through the requirements of
      setting up such a cluster and explained the advantages and disadvantages
      of running production workloads on Arm devices. (including running ceph on
      USB flash drives). During the session, participants got access to an
      interactive environment where I tried to debug and fix the crashes of the
      live application.
