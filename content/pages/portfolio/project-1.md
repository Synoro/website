    K3s runs on many devices - what happens if you have the perfect hardware to run it on?\n\nSee how easy it is to build\_a portable Kubernetes cluster with a Clusterboard.\n\nI walked the participants\_through the requirements of setting up such a cluster and explained the advantages and disadvantages of running production workloads on Arm devices. (including running ceph on USB flash drives).\n\nDuring the session, participants\_got access to an interactive environment where I\_tried to debug and fix the crashes of the live application.\n\n[Episode 01 - GitHub](https://github.com/danacr/Kubernetes-The-Fun-Way/blob/master/01-portable-kubernetes-cluster/README.md)\n
